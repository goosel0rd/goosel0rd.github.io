# Post 1 - setup and initial thoughts
Initially I had some problems getting a correct environment and such to run my dev container in and found the whole process somewhat confusing. And with the constant crashing of my docker for windows it was somewhat of an arduous process. However once sorted the docker container system showed me how useful an containerised environment can be, with easy access to resources and a simple start up and start down process.
My initial thoughts for this assignment involved the difficulties of figuring out python tkinter and finding a suitable way to store variables in a database that could be reliably accessed later. Additionally I gave a proper read over the given code and spent time figuring out how it could be implemented in my environment simply across multiple function.
