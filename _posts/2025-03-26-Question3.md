# Question 3
# Difficuilties
I had a large number of difficulties with the lab computers and getting them to work over the network. Problems such as disappearing lab computers and lengthy setups stopped progress multiple times. Ultimately I had to do the whole section in one sitting knowing that I could not count on the lab computer to be there for me if I ever came back. Additionally setting up docker provided issues in user privileges and many driver issues needed to be solved through an update.
