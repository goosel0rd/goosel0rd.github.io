# Question 1
# setup
Initially I had some problems getting a correct environment and such to run my dev container in and found the whole process somewhat confusing. And with the constant crashing of my docker for windows it was somewhat of an arduous process. However once sorted the docker container system showed me how useful an containerised environment can be, with easy access to resources and a simple start up and start down process.

# Initial thoughts
My initial thoughts for this assignment involved the difficulties of figuring out python tkinter and finding a suitable way to store variables in a database that could be reliably accessed later. Additionally I gave a proper read over the given code and spent time figuring out how it could be implemented in my environment simply across multiple function.

# Re figuring out python
Once figured out, python is a pretty straightforward programming language coming from the head falls of c. And although it has been many years since CSSE1001 it was still easy to pick up and figure out tkinter for the gui portion of this assessment. The main challenge I faced was the confusion of a programming language without brackets and most importantly figuring out the recognition code given in the jupyter notebook to fully understand the needed concepts.

# Reading the given materials
Going through the given material gave me an opportunity to test and understand the code for the assignment. For each step I ran the code on different images and observed the results compared to the given fingerprint, then I compared each fingerprint example to see which code comes into play for each stage of question 1. Once figured out I wrote and copied the functions that I needed adding in function calls to a py file. Shown below is the before and after code that was changed.

```python
def follow_ridge_and_compute_angle(cn, neighborhood_values, nd_lut, x, y, d = 8):
    px, py = x, y
    length = 0.0
    while length < 20: # max length followed
        next_directions = nd_lut[neighborhood_values[py,px]][d]
        if len(next_directions) == 0:
            break
        # Need to check ALL possible next directions
        if (any(cn[py + xy_steps[nd][1], px + xy_steps[nd][0]] != 2 for nd in next_directions)):
            break # another minutia found: we stop here
        # Only the first direction has to be followed
        d = next_directions[0]
        ox, oy, l = xy_steps[d]
        px += ox ; py += oy ; length += l
    # check if the minimum length for a valid direction has been reached
    return math.atan2(-py+y, px-x) if length >= 10 else None
```

```python
def follow_ridge_and_compute_angle(x, y, d = 8):
    px, py = x, y
    length = 0.0
    while length < 20: # max length followed
        next_directions = nd_lut[neighborhood_values[py,px]][d]
        if len(next_directions) == 0:
            break
        # Need to check ALL possible next directions
        if (any(cn[py + xy_steps[nd][1], px + xy_steps[nd][0]] != 2 for nd in next_directions)):
            break # another minutia found: we stop here
        # Only the first direction has to be followed
        d = next_directions[0]
        ox, oy, l = xy_steps[d]
        px += ox ; py += oy ; length += l
    # check if the minimum length for a valid direction has been reached
    return math.atan2(-py+y, px-x) if length >= 10 else None
```
