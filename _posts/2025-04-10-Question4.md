# Question 4
# Problems
One of the many problems I faced with this question was the rise of AI images being downloaded when I would request images. These pictures are not only classified wrong but are completely incomprehensible to any form of classification. I guess this is a sign of the current state of google images and web images in general, referred to as ai slop I find these images useless and a waste of everyoneâ€™s time. The only way I could get these to go away was to restrict the time of search to before 2020 where dogs, planes and cats existed but not Ai images. Code is shown below:

```python
def search_images(term, max_images=200, max_year=2020):
```

Below is an example of what I was talking about

# SNE
I found t-SNE really difficult to get working and found very little examples of code to figure out what I needed to do. Examples where normally much more complex than what was needed and represented in the 3d space
